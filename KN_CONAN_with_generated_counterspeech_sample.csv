Jews totally run Hollywood.,"And Jews in California intermarried with Christians at the highest rate among urban Jews in the country.""California Jews have been given a level of choice that few other American Jews have enjoyed,"" he says.Dollinger says that American Jews were reluctant to acknowledge the presence of large numbers of Jews who were born in Israel and lived in a kibbutz society but chose to live in Southern California.In the movie industry, that resulted in an odd juxtaposition as the moguls green-lighted Biblical epics.The book's 15 essays highlight other lesser-known aspects of Jewish history as well: the influence of women; the lives of ordinary people; the efforts of Jews to help the Japanese interned during World War II; and the denial by Jews of the Israel expatriates who settled in Southern California.They didn't want to admit that Jews born in what was considered the Promised Land would leave Israel permanently.","There are two facts you should know about Jews, Hollywood and California. First, Jews in California intermarried with Christians at the highest rate among urban Jews in the country, so there are less and less ""Jews"" strictu sensu in Hollywood.

"If feminism were really about equality, they would call their movement ""equalism"" or some similar crap.","Is there still a place in modern-day America for a gender-equality movement? “ I don’t need feminism because I believe in equality, not entitlements and supremacy.”A true equality movement would be concerned with the needs and interests of both sexes.Many others, however, say they repudiate feminism even though — indeed, because — they support equality and female empowerment: Female anti-feminism is nothing new.But, while the anti-feminist rebellion has its eye-rolling moments, it raises valid questions about the state of Western feminism in the 21st century — questions that must be addressed if we are to continue making progress toward real gender equality.","Is there still a place in modern-day world for a gender-equality movement? Of course feminism believes in equality, not entitlements and supremacy, but it needs to focus on the weaker sex.",Misogyny,"In the end, it is up to each individual to decide whether or not they want to participate in a movement that aims to achieve equality for all, regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, or physical or cognitive abilities.

LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school.,"“Sexual orientation and gender identity terms will be discussed with focus on appreciation for individual differences.” “Students will be provided definitions for sexual orientation terms heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality; and the gender identity term transgender,” Eighth graders will be taught that individual identity “occurs over a lifetime and includes the component of sexual orientation and gender identity.” Last week, the school board voted to include gender identity in the district’s nondiscrimination policy – a decision that was strongly opposed by parents. However, Torre told me that parents will indeed be able to opt out of those classes “including the sexual orientation and gender identity lessons.” “Individual identity will also be described as having four parts – biological gender, gender identity (includes transgender), gender role, and sexual orientation (includes heterosexual, bisexual, and homosexual).”","If gender identity is taught to foster nondiscrimination policy and parents are indeed able to opt out of those classes, what is the problem?",Homophobia,"Gender Identity and Sexual orientation are personal orientations that are not related to one's biological sex. Gender is a social construct and has nothing to do with one's anatomy. Sexual orientation is a personal preference that can be expressed in many ways, and each person has the right to choose how to live their life.   If you want to learn more about gender and sexuality, you should talk to a real person, not just a bunch of gender stereotypes spread around in social media and in the media.  Gender and sexuality are not social construct, they are personal feelings that are strongly influenced by one's own experiences.  Sexuality is not a ""code word"" for gender."
Women should stop whining: there are no professions barred to them in Western Society.,"In the United States, women make up about 12 percent of engineering professors, one of the lowest percentages in all STEM fields, where women are more likely to make up 18 to 22 percent of the faculty.While that news is hardly shocking, a new National Science Foundation report released on Saturday about why so few women go into engineering, or stay in the field, highlights a key reason: a workplace culture of incivility toward women.The findings add weight and context to previous looks at why more women don’t go into or don’t stay in STEM fields.Of the women who left the field less than five years ago, two-thirds pursued better opportunities in other fields, — 72 percent became either managers or executives.Yet fewer than 11 percent of all engineers are women.Another report by the American Association of University Women, “Why So Few?”",Let me introduce you the example of the STEM field In the United States.

homosexuality is a mental illness that can be cured [link],"Despite Peter and Kenneth having lived through the years where being gay was considered a mental illness, their love and their life together survived and flourished. For more than 30 years, the major health and mental health professional organizations in the United States have agreed that heterosexuality, bisexuality and homosexuality are all variations of sexual orientation. In contrast, Minnesota congresswoman and presidential candidate Michele Bachmann and her husband, Marcus, have both publicly supported the proposition that homosexuality can be cured through therapy, prayer, or a combination of the two. Individuals who seek “reparative therapy” to become heterosexual often do so because of personal distress, possibly caused by family, or societal pressures, or by teachings from those religious traditions that condemn bisexuality and homosexuality. Can an individual’s sexual orientation be changed through therapy? There can be no justification for discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, including the use of “reparative” therapies.","For more than 30 years, the major health and mental health professional organizations in the United States have agreed that heterosexuality, bisexuality and homosexuality are all variations of sexual orientation.

Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities therefore their life is less valuable.,"Humans, according to Professor Singer’s critique of “speciesism,” have no intrinsic claim to life. The field promises valuable insights into early human development and new possibilities for treating diseases and disorders. The interests of individuals depend upon their cognitive abilities and on “characteristics like rationality, autonomy, and self-consciousness.” Many scientists chafe at restrictions on their ability to learn more about life and potentially create breakthrough therapies. The intractability of this issue reflects the fact that, as a matter of biology, the development of human life is rarely characterized by clear lines.

Jewish people are also the victims of hate crime and discrimination, and this is why we need to work together to eradicate these harmful stereotypes.   If you are a person of color and live in a white-majority community, you are more likely to experience anti-black racism than you are to face it from people of color living in a majority-minority community.  Therefore, it is very important to fight anti-"

There is an invasion on a level never seen before in history. Millions of people pouring across our borders replacing our race and culture.,"The notion of race is a non-issue in a metropolis that has become a microcosm of an increasingly globalized world. It is often described as the most globalized city on the planet (42% of the population are foreign-born) with a top ten quality-of-life index, and the world's fastest growing economy. Cities are chameleonic; their fortunes ebb and flow with the tide of history. Travel writer, Jan Morris once derided the city for its coarseness, but by the 1990s she had done a volte-face, hailing it as ""one of the great cities of the world"". Situated like a modern Greek city-state on Malaysia's southern tip, Singapore epitomises all the hallmarks of a slick forward-thinking city: a prime Pacific Rim location, an eclectic melting pot of different cultures, unrivalled economic clout and a public transport system that makes driving a car seem almost redundant.

Why gays do not try to heal?,"And, contrary to Perry's insinuation, sexual orientation is not like a disease. More recent studies have identified other potential links between homosexuality and genetics, and scientists have offered explanations on how same-sex attraction could advance procreation. But finding the biological origins of same-sex attraction has the potential to undermine the rights of gays and lesbians. Why would a gene related to sexual orientation be useful? Studies of identical twins, who share the same genes, have shown that, if one twin is gay, the other is more likely to be gay, suggesting sexual orientation is influenced by genetics. Scientific studies have demonstrated that biology plays a role in one's sexual orientation.","Contrary to some insinuations, sexual orientation is not like a disease.",Homophobia,"Homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual orientation. 5% of the population simply love people of the same sex.

Homosexuals are not a plague, they are a part of the human family.   (link to article about the Gallup poll about same-sex attraction)   The fact that some people are attracted to more than one gender does not imply that they are diseased or that they should be isolated from the rest of the world.

A 2012 Department of Labor study found that “only 13% of men who took parental leave received pay compared with 21% for women.” “Traditional gender responsibilities at work and home are evolving and resulting in the need for more progressive parental leave policies to better support women and men in the workplace,” Karyn Twaronite, EY Global Diversity & Inclusiveness Officer, said in a press release at the time.","You are completely right, I understand your concern: given the cultural biases about men, work, and family none of the two fathers would take the leave when they’re given it and the baby would be left home alone...",Homophobia,"You are entitled to love whoever you want, as long as you are not forcing anyone to love you. Love does not have to be heterosexual. Love can be from someone of any gender, sexuality, religion, or sexual orientation. Love is possible between people of all genders, religions, and sexual orientations. It is also possible to love someone of the same sex.   Love is not a choice.  Love can come from anyone, regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or physical ability. Love has nothing to do with ""race"". Love is about being in love with someone who is different from you, and that is what we should all strive for. Love changes us, not the other way around."
Gays are just sick. They cannot marry. It is an abomination,"""In Uganda, we look at homosexuality as an abomination. American gay activists have sent money to help the community here. Gays in Cameroon have been attacked by police and targeted in the media. Local newspapers are outing gays, potentially inciting the public to attack them, activists say. Western governments - including aid donors - have vocally criticized the bill and denounced the treatment of gays. They say their goal is to change the sexual behavior of gays, not to physically harm them.","Maybe you are one of those persons that says: ""my goal is to change the sexual behavior of gays, not to physically harm them"". But the result of your words is just inciting the public to attack them.",Homophobia,"The idea that being gay is a choice is just wrong. I don't see the connection between being gay and wanting to spend time with someone of the same sex. I think it is more accurate to think of it as a behavioral preference that can and should be respected, rather than as a 'choice'. I think that is more in keeping with the modern world, in which we live in.

"Hijab means Islam, Islam means woman and child oppression, rapism, intolerance, chauvinism. I do not like hijab and everything else that follows!","Comprehensive data on the effect of discrimination and hate crimes targeting Muslim women are hard to find.But for Muslim women, these isolated incidents of misogyny or violence have taken on an additional, ugly edge.According to one researcher, 69 percent of Muslim women who wore hijab reported at least one incident of discrimination; for those who did not wear hijab, it was 29 percent.To Muslim women, these numbers aren’t abstract.Through clenched teeth, he ranted that Muslim men are rapists and terrorists, and that Muslim women are victims of their own oppression.In each study, women who wore visible symbols of Islam such as a hijab or niqab were more likely to be targeted.","It is intollerance that brings oppression to Muslim women, not Islam.

"Some races are poor because they are inferior, also in the eye of the Lord.","Young people, and even adults, often wonder how all the varieties or ""races"" of people could come from the same original human ancestors. The Bible clearly teaches that God created all human beings in His image. Just as some individuals today carry genes to produce descendants with different color hair and eyes, humanity's first parents, Adam and Eve, possessed genes to produce all the variety and races of men. Thus, both will have different abilities to affect the eye color of their offspring. Of course not! You and I today may not carry the genes to produce every variety or race of humans, but humanity's first parents did possess such genes.","You and I today may not carry the genes to produce every variety or race of humans, but humanity's first parents did possess such genes.

Intolerance and violence can increase when mass migration happens.,"Even so, I believe there is genuine potential for mutual understanding. From this perspective, mutual understanding among these traditions is not merely the business of religious believers — it matters for the welfare of humanity as a whole. Though intolerance may be as old as religion itself, we still see vigorous signs of its virulence. Now I see how naïve I was, and how dangerous the extremes of religious intolerance can be today. The pressure this creates tests more than our tolerance — it demands that we promote peaceful coexistence and understanding across boundaries. In Europe, there are intense debates about newcomers wearing veils or wanting to erect minarets and episodes of violence against Muslim immigrants.","The extremes of intolerance can be very dangerous, I agree with you, but it demands that we promote peaceful coexistence and understanding across boundaries, not fear-mongering.",Racism,"Intolerance of other peoples religious beliefs is incompatible with human dignity and should be condemned. Intolerance is a form of religious motivated violence that has no place in a modern democratic state. Violence is a crime regardless of one's religious beliefs. We should try to decrease the number of cases of intolerance instead of fueling the flames of conflict. (Dialogue with Muslim community, Oxford, UK, 2017)  Counterspeech: I agree that there is a need for increased efforts to tackle hate crime, but scapegoating the Muslim community does not help us target the real problem. Instead, we should be working on building trust and understanding between different communities, especially when it comes to social and economic issues. This will hopefully lead to a decrease in incidents of hate crime"
Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV.,"The U.S. blood supply is facing new safety threats, exposing patients to potentially greater risk of disease from transfusions. One fear is that a major new blood-borne disease in the U.S. could have an impact similar to the AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s, when more than 14,000 people acquired the disease from blood transfusions before donated blood was tested for HIV starting in 1985. “But transfusions have risks, and they can transmit infectious disease and cause reactions. “Blood saves lives,” says Matthew Kuehnert, director of the Office of Blood, Organ and Other Tissue Safety for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pathogen-reduction technology offers an insurance policy of sorts, inactivating some transfusion threats without damaging blood components. Even with its limitations, pathogen reduction allows blood centers to be more “proactive” about reducing disease threats, and could reduce costs by eliminating the need for some testing, according to Edward Snyder, a professor of laboratory medicine at Yale School of Medicine and director of transfusion services at Yale-New Haven Hospital.","Instead of focusing on long standing misconceptions (i.e. gays equal HIV), why don't we use pathogen-reduction technology that can inactivate some transfusion threats without damaging blood components? Even with its limitations, pathogen reduction allows blood centers to be more “proactive” about reducing disease threats and allow more people to be eligible for blood donation. I think this is a much fairer approach.",Homophobia,"This is not true. Homosexuals are not jeopardizing patient safety by donating blood. Instead, they are contributing to the research and development of new treatments for diseases that afflict heterosexuals as well.  If you really cared about patient safety, you would call for a moratorium on all forms of sexual orientation discrimination.  The same could be said for any other group, but especially about the LGBTI community.   If we truly cared about the health of our fellow human beings, we should call for the end of homophobia.  Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a behavioral preference, and it is perfectly fine to have different sexual orientations. It is also perfectly fine"
Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.,"The same phenomenon is evident in the Islamic world.Over the last 40 years, Islamic militancy has thrived on the perception that Muslims are victims, whether in the US, Europe or on a global scale.the sweeping rightwing gains in French regional elections make clear, populist prejudice is hardly rare in the west.Shortly after the seizure of the Iraqi city of Mosul in June last year, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the self-appointed Caliph and leader of Isis issued a message that summed up the world view not just of his own groups but of all Islamic militants in the early part of this century.The long and complex history of interchange between cultures and communities is ignored, and replaced with a narrative of a single global conflict between belief and unbelief, between the west and their proxies in the Islamic world and true Muslims.In the 18th century, an Ottoman scholar described contemporary European states as so backward and barbaric as to not be “worthy of attention”.","The long and complex history of interchange between cultures and communities is ignored, and replaced with a narrative of a single global conflict between belief and unbelief, between the west and their proxies in the Islamic world and true Muslims.

It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims!,"1 FLR 571, 573, 576, that male circumcision does involve harm, or the risk of harm.The fact that it may be a “cultural” practice does not make FGM reasonable; indeed, the proposition is specifically negatived by section 1(5) of the 2003 Act.It is at this point in the analysis, as it seems to me, that the clear distinction between FGM and male circumcision appears.FGM has no basis in any religion; male circumcision is often performed for religious reasons.In my judgment, any form of FGM constitutes “significant harm” within the meaning of section[] 31 …. So, he submits, it can never be reasonable parenting to inflict any form of FGM on a child.","While male circumcision is often performed for religious reasons, FGM has no basis in any religion, so the religion of her parents has nothing to do with this cruelty.",Islamophobia,"If you really cared about women and girls, you would know that FGM is not a Muslim-specific problem. It is a global problem that affects all people regardless of religion. Muslims are the second largest group of people affected by FGM, after Christians. According to the World Health Organisation, more than 100 countries worldwide have high or very high rates of female genital mutilation (FGM). Around the world, up to 90% of girls and women experience some form of gender-based violence, often perpetrated by a family member, partner, or member of a community member. Fgm is a serious breach of human rights and can have serious negative effects on girls' and women's mental and physical health."
There is an invasion on a level never seen before in history. Millions of people pouring across our borders replacing our race and culture.,"The notion of race is a non-issue in a metropolis that has become a microcosm of an increasingly globalized world. It is often described as the most globalized city on the planet (42% of the population are foreign-born) with a top ten quality-of-life index, and the world's fastest growing economy. Cities are chameleonic; their fortunes ebb and flow with the tide of history. Travel writer, Jan Morris once derided the city for its coarseness, but by the 1990s she had done a volte-face, hailing it as ""one of the great cities of the world"". Situated like a modern Greek city-state on Malaysia's southern tip, Singapore epitomises all the hallmarks of a slick forward-thinking city: a prime Pacific Rim location, an eclectic melting pot of different cultures, unrivalled economic clout and a public transport system that makes driving a car seem almost redundant. Yet, perhaps the most understated of Vancouver's city-of-the-moment credentials is its underlying inclusiveness.","Look at the most globalized cities on the planet, with top quality-of-life index, and some of the world's fastest growing economy. They epitomise all the hallmarks of slick forward-thinking cities because they are eclectic melting pot of different cultures thanks to underlying inclusiveness.

And most Muslim nations are not joining with the West to confront that therefore, criticism of Islam's role on the world stage is certainly valid. All I'm saying is that liberal principles like freedom of speech, freedom to practice any religion you want without fear of violence, freedom to leave a religion, equality for women, equality for minorities, including homosexuals -- these are liberal principles that liberals applaud for So you can see that millions of Muslims think their religion should dictate what happens in society.
