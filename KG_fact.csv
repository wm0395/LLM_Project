The vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.,"A part-time job, on the other hand, didn’t seem to raise questions about the commitment of female job applicants.David Pedulla, a sociologist at the University of Texas at Austin, sent out thousands of fake resumes to test how gender and work history affected callbacks by potential employers looking to interview the simulated job candidates.They, too, found that taking a “low-level interim job,” such as retail cashier, greatly reduced the likelihood of a callback for a job interview.Temp work, on the other hand, generated a 7.1% callback rate for men –the highest in the study outside of a full-time job — and an 8.3% callback rate for women.Where Just a Misdemeanor Could Keep You Out of a Job (April 26) Elevated Level of Part-Time Employment: Post-Recession Norm?“Alternatively, if an applicant has taken a low-level interim job, they may be better off not listing this job on their resume.”","David Pedulla, a sociologist at the University of Texas at Austin, sent out thousands of fake resumes to test how gender and work history affected callbacks by potential employers looking to interview the simulated job candidates.

homosexuality is a mental illness that can be cured [link],"Despite Peter and Kenneth having lived through the years where being gay was considered a mental illness, their love and their life together survived and flourished. For more than 30 years, the major health and mental health professional organizations in the United States have agreed that heterosexuality, bisexuality and homosexuality are all variations of sexual orientation. In contrast, Minnesota congresswoman and presidential candidate Michele Bachmann and her husband, Marcus, have both publicly supported the proposition that homosexuality can be cured through therapy, prayer, or a combination of the two. Individuals who seek “reparative therapy” to become heterosexual often do so because of personal distress, possibly caused by family, or societal pressures, or by teachings from those religious traditions that condemn bisexuality and homosexuality. Can an individual’s sexual orientation be changed through therapy? There can be no justification for discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, including the use of “reparative” therapies.","For more than 30 years, the major health and mental health professional organizations in the United States have agreed that heterosexuality, bisexuality and homosexuality are all variations of sexual orientation.

Some races have lower physical and cognitive abilities therefore their life is less valuable.,"Humans, according to Professor Singer’s critique of “speciesism,” have no intrinsic claim to life. The field promises valuable insights into early human development and new possibilities for treating diseases and disorders. The interests of individuals depend upon their cognitive abilities and on “characteristics like rationality, autonomy, and self-consciousness.” Many scientists chafe at restrictions on their ability to learn more about life and potentially create breakthrough therapies. The intractability of this issue reflects the fact that, as a matter of biology, the development of human life is rarely characterized by clear lines. Killing an adult chimpanzee would be, for him, a more immoral act than killing a 1-year-old child, because the chimpanzee has greater cognitive capacities.","Following your reasoning, killing an adult chimpanzee could be a more immoral act than killing a 1-year-old child, because the chimpanzee has greater cognitive and physical capacities than a toddler.",Racism,0

The real target of much of this criticism, however, is not multiculturalism but immigration and immigrants — especially Muslims.

The claims of minorities upon society were defined less by the social and political needs of individuals than by the box to which they belonged.

homosexuality is a mental illness that can be cured [link],"Despite Peter and Kenneth having lived through the years where being gay was considered a mental illness, their love and their life together survived and flourished. For more than 30 years, the major health and mental health professional organizations in the United States have agreed that heterosexuality, bisexuality and homosexuality are all variations of sexual orientation. In contrast, Minnesota congresswoman and presidential candidate Michele Bachmann and her husband, Marcus, have both publicly supported the proposition that homosexuality can be cured through therapy, prayer, or a combination of the two. Individuals who seek “reparative therapy” to become heterosexual often do so because of personal distress, possibly caused by family, or societal pressures, or by teachings from those religious traditions that condemn bisexuality and homosexuality. Can an individual’s sexual orientation be changed through therapy? There can be no justification for discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, including the use of “reparative” therapies.","Individuals who seek “reparative therapy” to become heterosexual often do so because of personal distress, possibly caused by family, or societal pressures, or by teachings from those religious traditions that condemn bisexuality and homosexuality.

Why gays do not try to heal?,"We must always consider the person. it is not possible to interfere spiritually in the life of a person.” In life, God accompanies persons, and we must accompany them, starting from their situation. A person once asked me, in a provocative manner, if I approved of homosexuality. “The Jesuit must be a person whose thought is incomplete, in the sense of open-ended thinking,” he said. I said that if a homosexual person is of good will and is in search of God, I am no one to judge.","We must always consider the person. it is not possible to interfere in the personal preferences of a person. If a homosexual person is of good will, I am no one to judge or to try to heal them.",Homophobia,0
